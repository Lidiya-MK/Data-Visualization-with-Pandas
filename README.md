# Data-Visualization-with-Pandas

I recently completed a course by Madecraft and Michael Galarnyk on Python Data Visualization. I wanted to put my skills to the test so I decided to create this project. 

From the course I learned how to:
1. filter and clean large datasets imported from .xlsx and .csv files.
2. Locate Nan entries to avoid errors during plotting.
3. Present filtered data in a visually pleasing manner using pandas matplotlib and seaborn. 
4. MATLAB style and Object style syntax for Matplotlib 
5. Exporting plotted pandas Dataframes.
